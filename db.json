She teaches them a game which her father made up about finding something to be glad about in everything.\r\nFor example she tells an invalid named Mrs White that she can be glad that not everybody is a life long invalid like she is.

When Mary arrived in the house she was a disagreeable child although she often thought that other people were. She never thought much about others, although she didn't know she was doing it. Mary spends most of her time outside, in the gardens and after a while the fresh air makes her less and less disagreeable. Martha, her maid, tells her about a wonderful secret garden, that had been locked for 10 years. Mary is so intrigued that she decides to look for the Garden's door and for the buried key at once. One day, while walking in the gardens, Mary meets a gardener, who has a little friend robin. The little robin shows Mary the door and the key to the Secret Garden. Mary is delighted she starts to dig in the garden and look at all the little weeds that have started to grow. That evening Mary tells Martha that she would like to have a little spade so she gives Martha some of her money and Martha sends a message to her brother, Dickon, to buy a set of garden tools and bring them over. Dickon gives the tools to Mary and she tells him her secret, about the secret garden. She know that she can trust him because all the birds and animals trust him about where their nests and holes are. As Mary and Dickon walked around the garden Dickon showed Mary all the wick spots that she hadn't noticed before \u2013 these were signs that the plants in the gardens are still alive.\r\n\r\n\u201c It's as wick as you or me,\" he said; and Mary remembered that Martha had told her that \"wick\" meant \"alive\" or \"lively.\"\"I'm glad it's wick!\" she cried out in her whisper. \"I want them all to be wick. Let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones there are.\"\r\n\r\nMary and Dickon began to work in the garden and make it come to life once again. They dug out the weeds and planted flowers.\r\n\r\nOne night Mary hears crying. The following night she hears it again. After some exploration Mary finds out that it is her cousin, Colin. Colin's mother had died 10 years before. His father could not bear looking at his son because his eyes looked just like his mother's. Most of the rooms in his large mansion had been locked for those ten years, and Colin, was hidden and not to be mentioned. Colin, is an invalid, always ill, and in hysterics, he is a completely spoiled child:\r\n\r\n\u201cEh! poor lad! He's been spoiled till salt won't save him. Mother says as th' two worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his own way--or always to have it. She doesn't know which is th' worst.\u201d\r\n\r\nMary and Colin become friends. Colin likes having Mary near him, because she makes him forget that he is ill. She tells him about the secret garden and talks to him about all the wonderful things in his father's great mansion. At last they are allowed to go outside together Dickon pushes Colin's wheelchair and they take him to the garden although nobody except the three of them know about the garden. Colin finds out that it was once his mother's garden and decides that it will now be his garden. After some time when Colin and Mary go out together with Dickon, Colin begins to be able to stand and walk by himself. At first, he can only do this by holding Mary's or Dickon's hand, but he learns to do it by himself by and by.\r\n\r\nFinally, Colin's father decides to dig for the buried key for the garden, just when Colin, Mary and Dickon are inside. They run outside without being aware that Colin's father was there. Mr. Craven, is amazed to see his son walking and running by himself. The all walk together back to the great mansion, and go around showing all the servants Colin walking by himself. From then on, Colin and his father like being together and happiness returns to the great mansion.", "quote": "\u201c It's as wick as you or me,\" he said; and Mary remembered that Martha had told her that \"wick\" meant \"alive\" or \"lively.\"\"I'm glad it's wick!\" she cried out in her whisper. \"I want them all to be wi", "rating": 3}}, {"model": "readings.book", "pk": 4, "fields": {"added_by": 2, "name": "Pollyanna", "author": "Eleanor H.
